## About MC<sup>3</sup>

The Monmouth County Curriculum Consortium (MC<sup>3</sup>) is a non-profit educational organization dedicated to sharing ideas and resources to improve learning and leadership in our schools. Since its founding in 2009, it has expanded beyond Monmouth County to include over 60 districts in central New Jersey. Its September-June monthly meeting schedule presents a variety of opportunities to discuss topics like assessment, curriculum, technology, and pedagogy. Attendees typically include district and building administrators, teachers, tech specialists, and representatives from the NJ Department of Education.

MC<sup>3</sup> also organizes workshops 3-4 times per year to provide in depth training on educational issues. In the past few years, these have included summits on Common Core, the Next Gen Science standards, Instructional Technology, and ESL, to name a few.

In addition to the districts which make up the consortium, MC<sup>3</sup> has partnered with the NJDOE, NJ School Boards Association, Monmouth University, Rutgers University, and many education-related organizations.
